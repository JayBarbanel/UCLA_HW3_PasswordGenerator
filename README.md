# UCLA_HW3_PasswordGenerator
# TheProject 
We were given instructions to build a password generator that when prompt, would require the user to submit if they would like numbers, 
special characters, upper case and lower case letters.  The password that would be generated would be between 8 and 128 characters.  

# The Process 
The process of this assignment was tough.  I did a lot of reseach, as JavaScript is still pretty confusing to me.  The first step I took was to assign my varaibles.  I wrote out varaiables for each of the 4 criteria that the user needed to be able to chose from (Special Chaacters, Numbers, Upper and Lower case letters). 

I needed to create an addEventListener, which would allowe the click of the generate password button. In order to generatre the password, I used prompts to allow the use to make their decitions on character/number count, upper and lower case letters.  If the number selected is less than 8 or more than 128, an alert is called that askes the user to resubmit their answer.  The code then goes through the if statements to ultimatley brings you to the made password.
